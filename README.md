# Resources & More
Here are some books and other resources that I found useful in learning the foundations of mathematics and machine learning. I hope you find them useful too!

## Fundamentals of Matrix Algebra
This is a great resource with many illustrative examples and exercises including matrix arithmatic, operations, and properties. This website is a free and public resource for anyone wanting to learn the fundamentals of matrix algebra. The best part is that it has a vast collection of exercises for one to practice.

## Overleaf
Overlead has a great collection of examples for writing in LaTex. Specifically its math section is very useful for learning how to write and document math equations and was used throughout the entierty of this repository.
