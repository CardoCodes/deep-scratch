    "# Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "The Uniform Code of Military Justice specifies court martial for any officer who sends a soldier into battle without a weapon. In a similar fashion, students should be well armed with an understanding of linear algebra beofre they are sent out to learn naural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with vector spaces. A vector space is a collection of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied by numbers, called scalars. Vectors are often used to represent data points, such as the features of a data set. Vectors are also used to represent model parameters, such as the weights and biases of a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to better understand linear algebra, we will first review the basic concepts of scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it simply a scalar is just a number. For now this is all we need to know about scalars. We will revisit them later when we discuss tensors. All you have to know is that they are usually denoted by lower case letters, such as $s$ or $n$. You will also often see the extression \"Let $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$\" which means that $s$ is a scalar and is a member of the set of real numbers, or \"Let $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$\" which means that $n$ is a scalar and is a member of the set of natural numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are one step above scalars. Vectors are a collection of numbers in the form of an array. Here is an example of a vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of these numbers as points in space or features in a dataset. The numbers in the vector are called the components of the vector. The number of components in a vector is called the dimension of the vector. In the example above, the vector $x$ has three components and is a three dimensional vector. Vectors are usually denoted by lower case bold letters, such as $\\mathbf{x}$ or $\\mathbf{y}$. The components of a vector are usually denoted by lower case letters with subscripts, such as $x_1$ or $y_2$. The components of a vector can be accessed by their index, such as $x[0]$ or $y[1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a better understanding of how we will be using vectors in python lets try to write a simple vector operation.\n"
