# Math and ML Foundations
The purpose of this section is to provide a quick refresher on the mathematical foundations that are used in machine learning. This section is not meant to be a comprehensive review of the mathematical foundations, but rather a quick refresher on the topics that are most relevant to machine learning.

This section covers the essential building blocks in mathematics and machine learning that are necessary for understanding and implementing deep learning algorithms. The topics covered in this section include: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability and Statistics.

## Linear Algebra
Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with vector spaces. Linear algebra is a fundamental tool in machine learning. It is used to represent and understand many machine learning concepts and processes, such as the parameters of a model, the input data, and the predictions.

### Scalars
A scalar is a single number, typically used to represent a magnitude or quantity. In machine learning, scalars are often used to represent model parameters, such as weights and biases.

### Vectors
A vector is an ordered list of numbers, typically used to represent a point in space. In machine learning, vectors are often used to represent data points or features.

### Matrices
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, typically used to represent a linear transformation. In machine learning, matrices are often used to represent data sets or model parameters.

### Tensors
A tensor is a multi-dimensional array of numbers, generalizing the concepts of scalars, vectors, and matrices. In machine learning, tensors are often used to represent high-dimensional data or model parameters.
