# Math and ML Foundations
This section covers the essential building blocks in mathematics and machine learning that are necessary for understanding and implementing deep learning algorithms. We will introduce the fundamental concepts of scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors, and explain how they are used in machine learning.

## Scalars
A scalar is a single number, typically used to represent a magnitude or quantity. In machine learning, scalars are often used to represent model parameters, such as weights and biases.

## Vectors
A vector is an ordered list of numbers, typically used to represent a point in space. In machine learning, vectors are often used to represent data points or features.

## Matrices
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, typically used to represent a linear transformation. In machine learning, matrices are often used to represent data sets or model parameters.

## Tensors
A tensor is a multi-dimensional array of numbers, generalizing the concepts of scalars, vectors, and matrices. In machine learning, tensors are often used to represent high-dimensional data or model parameters.
